# Hyperloop Control Center ðŸš„

Welcome to the *Hyperloop Control Center, a real-time control and monitoring system for tracking a simulated hyperloop route from **Chennai* to *Bangalore*. This project demonstrates a high-speed train simulation with live updates on speed, energy consumption, network stats, and position tracking on a real-time map.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- *Real-Time Map*: Visualize the hyperloop train moving from Chennai to Bangalore.
- *Speed & Distance Simulation*: Adjustable speeds with acceleration and deceleration effects.
- *Network Statistics*: Dynamic upload/download speeds based on current velocity.
- *Energy Monitoring*: Calculates energy consumption as the train progresses.
- *Graphical Analysis*: Displays real-time graphs for speed, distance, network speed, and energy consumption.
