# Hyperloop Control Center ðŸš„

Welcome to the *Hyperloop Control Center, a real-time control and monitoring system for tracking a simulated hyperloop route from **Chennai* to *Bangalore*. This project demonstrates a high-speed train simulation with live updates on speed, energy consumption, network stats, and position tracking on a real-time map.
